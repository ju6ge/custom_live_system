Customizable Rescue System
==========================

This repository includes a script and a dracut module. Its purpose is to create a bootable iso or disk image using dracut to create an directly bootable unified kernel image. It supports booting via Ventoy and is based on archlinux.

For now this is only for my personal usage.
